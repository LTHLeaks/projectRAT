# ProjectRat

old rat i made, has a working chrome password extractor written in pure Java    
kinda inspired from yoink rat, made my own instead of pasting yoink rat cause of the HTTPS library i was using   

Learned a lot from this, definitely a cool experience

HTTPS library it uses: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient
